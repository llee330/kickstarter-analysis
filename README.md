Two analyses made in two new sheets; Outcomes Based on Goals and Outcomes Based on Launch Date. 
“Outcomes Based on Goals” utilizes Excel commands; Countifs(), percentage calculation and addition. A new sheet “Kickstarter Plays” is created to show only the Plays subcategory so I can insert a line chart based on that. The relationship between monetary goal and successful/failed rate is observed and conclusions are made with limitation of the chart been addressed. I’ve suggested additional research to be done as required by this challenge. 

“Outcomes Based on Launch Date”. I created a pivot table and was able to identify the columns, rows, values and filters in the pivot table fields. I then created a line chart to see the relationship between months and the count of outcomes. I assessed the chart and draw up conclusions, limitation and suggestion.
