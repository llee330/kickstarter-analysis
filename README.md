Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Excel Kickstarter Challenge

Two analyses made in two new sheets; Outcomes Based on Goals and Outcomes Based on Launch Date. 
“Outcomes Based on Goals” utilizes Excel commands; Countifs(), percentage calculation and addition. A new sheet “Kickstarter Plays” is created to show only the Plays subcategory so I can insert a line chart based on that. The relationship between monetary goal and successful/failed rate is observed and conclusions are made with limitation of the chart been addressed. I’ve suggested additional research to be done as required by this challenge. 

“Outcomes Based on Launch Date”. I created a pivot table and was able to identify the columns, rows, values and filters in the pivot table fields. I then created a line chart to see the relationship between months and the count of outcomes. I assessed the chart and draw up conclusions, limitation and suggestion.

• The most successful Kickstarter campaigns has goal set less than $1000.

• The higher the monetary goals, the higher failed rate presented. It is best to stay "conservative" and remain at lower set goals.

• For goals set at 35000 to 44999, successful rate is somewhat higher. A launched date should be researched to further see the pattern of data to find out the reason of having higher set goals and higher successful rates.

Limitations:-
This dataset is based on the range of fundraising goal on plays and has not indicated the dates when these projects were being held. The month of the year might affect successful and failed rate. 

Suggestion for additional tables of graphs:-
I suggest additional tables for the launched date based on months in the past years with the range of monetary goals.

• There were many successful Kickstarter campaigns in May and June for theater.  

• December might not be a great time to launch a theater campaign due to the lowest successful cases at this month. 

• The month of May also has the highest failed theatre campaigns, it might be due to the highest counts at this month. A chart for percentage of failed and successful should be plotted.

• As it progressed through the subsequent months from May, successful campaigns reduced. 

Limitations:-
1. Unable to draw conclusion on percentage of successful and failed based on this chart. 
2. This dataset is based on 7 years from 2010-2017. There was no "theatre" campaign in May of 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2017. I suggest more data for "theatre" of the month of May be collected to make this dataset more reliable. 

Suggestion for additional tables of graphs:-
I suggest additional tables for measures on percentage of successful and failed theater campaign, also measures of central tendency, measures of spread, and distributions chart with Box Plots.
